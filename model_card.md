- VLE Mean (-/day): Mean of the number of daily interactions with the VLE (Virtual Learning Environment) upto the threshold (nominally 50% of the way through the course)
- VLE Standard Deviation (-/day):  Standard Deviation of the number of daily interactions with the VLE upto the threshold (nominally 50% of the way through the course)

### Output:

A binary prediction if a student is likely to withdraw (1) or not (0)

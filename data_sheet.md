# DATASHEET

The data that was used to create, train and optimise the models were an open-source dataset provided by the Open University.

The data set can be found here: [Open University Learning Analytics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/open-university-learning-analytics-dataset/)


## Motivation

This dataset provides an intimate look into student performance and engagement. It grants researchers access to numerous salient metrics of academic performance which illuminate a broad spectrum of student behaviors: how students interact with online learning material; quantitative indicators reflecting their academic outcomes; as well as demographic data such as age group, gender, prior education level among others.

The main objective of this dataset is to enable analysts and educators alike with empirical insights underpinning individualized learning experiences - specifically in identifying cases when students may be 'at risk'. Given that preventive early interventions have been shown to significantly mitigate chances of course or program withdrawal among struggling students - having accurate predictive measures such as this can greatly steer pedagogical strategies towards being more success oriented.

## Composition

There are seven files, all in .csv format, that contain the information.

The files and number of instances are :
- students in courses: 32953
- course-presentations: 22
- VLE pages: 6364
- VLE log entries: 10655280
- registration entries: 32953
- assessments: 206
- assessment entries: 173912


There is missing data in the files.

The data does not contain confidential information. The data has been processed such that no individual student can be identified by their data.

## Collection process

There is no information on how the data was acquired, if the data is a sample of a larger subset, or the time frame over which the data was collected.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

Apart from sanitising the data to ensure student aninimity, there are no details about any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data
 
## Uses

There are some other uses that the data could be used for. These are:
- Analyzing Impact of Course Structure
- Personalized Learning Paths
- Online Learning Behavior Analysis

## Distribution

The dataset has been distributed on Kaggle.

The data set can be found here: [Open University Learning Analytics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/open-university-learning-analytics-dataset/)

## Maintenance

The expected update frequency is listed as "Never". So it appears that no-one will maintain the data.

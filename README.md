# PREDICTING STUDENT WITHDRAWALS AT UNIVERISTY, TO IMPROVE NON-CONTINAUTATION RATES.


## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
The purpose of this model is to predict at a given point during the course (nominally 50% through) if a student is likely to withdraw from the course.
Students withdrawing are classed as "non-continuation" students and are reported by the university.
The model uses data from the VLE (Virtual Learning Environment), Student Assessment grades and Student Registration information systems to  make the predictions.
